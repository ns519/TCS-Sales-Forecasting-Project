# TCS-Sales-Forecasting-Project
The objective of the project is to project the retail sales by applying forecasting tools and models on the historical sales record.

The historical dataset used for the project holds sales records of 50 items sold at 10 different stores from the 01-01-2013 to 31-12-2017. The data contains the date, item number, store where the purchase was recorded, and the total number of sales made on that day.
